# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================

# NOTE: Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before you set out to tweak and tune the configuration, make sure you
#       understand what you are trying to accomplish and the consequences.

# The primary way of configuring a node is via this file. This template lists
# the most important settings you may want to configure for a production cluster.
# Please consult the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html

# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------
# Path to directory where to store the data (separate multiple locations by comma):
path.data: /var/lib/elasticsearch

# Path to log files:
path.logs: /var/log/elasticsearch

#----------------------- BEGIN SECURITY AUTO CONFIGURATION -----------------------
# The following settings, TLS certificates, and keys have been automatically      
# generated to configure Elasticsearch security features.

# Enabled security features
xpack.security.enabled: {{ xpack_security_enabled | default(false) }}

xpack.security.enrollment.enabled: {{ xpack_security_enrollment_enabled | default(false) }}

# Enable encryption for HTTP API client connections, such as Kibana, Logstash, and Agents
xpack.security.http.ssl:
  enabled: true
  keystore.path: certs/http.p12

# Enable encryption and mutual authentication between cluster nodes
xpack.security.transport.ssl:
  enabled: true
  verification_mode: certificate
  keystore.path: certs/transport.p12
  truststore.path: certs/transport.p12
# Create a new cluster with the current node only
# Additional nodes can still join the cluster later
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["ip-172-31-18-207"]

# Allow HTTP API connections from anywhere
# Connections are encrypted and require user authentication
http.host: 0.0.0.0

# Allow other nodes to join the cluster from anywhere
# Connections are encrypted and mutually authenticated
#transport.host: 0.0.0.0
